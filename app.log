class GameManager:
    """
    The GameManager is responsible for overseeing the core game loop and managing interactions 
    between various subsystems. Its primary responsibilities include:

    1. **Game State Management**: 
       - Maintains the current state of the game (e.g., MainMenu, Playing, Paused, GameOver).
       - Transitions between states based on user input or game events.

    2. **System Coordination**:
       - Acts as a central hub to coordinate between systems such as InputManager, PhysicsEngine, 
         UIManager, AudioSystem, and SceneLoader.
       - Ensures that each system receives necessary updates and data at appropriate times.

    3. **Game Loop Control**:
       - Manages the main game loop, calling `Update()` and `Render()` methods for all active systems.
       - Handles time-step management to ensure consistent gameplay across different hardware.

    4. **Event Handling**:
       - Processes global game events (e.g., player death, level completion) and triggers appropriate 
         responses in other systems.
       - Uses an EventBus or Observer pattern to decouple event generation from handling.

    5. **Resource Management**:
       - Initializes and disposes of critical game resources (e.g., scenes, assets) during startup and shutdown.
       - Ensures efficient memory usage by unloading unused assets when necessary.

    Interaction with Other Systems:
    - **InputManager**: Receives player input and translates it into game actions.
    - **PhysicsEngine**: Updates physics simulations and resolves collisions.
    - **UIManager**: Controls rendering of menus, HUDs, and other UI elements.
    - **AudioSystem**: Manages background music, sound effects, and audio cues.
    - **SceneLoader**: Handles loading, unloading, and switching between game levels or scenes.

    Example Workflow:
    1. On game start, GameManager initializes all subsystems and loads the initial scene.
    2. During gameplay, it processes inputs, updates game logic, and renders frames.
    3. When a game event occurs (e.g., level complete), it transitions to the next state and notifies relevant systems.

Explain the functionality and implementation details of the `GameManager` class in Python, focusing on its core methods such as `add_player`, `update_score`, `get_leaderboard`, `advance_level`, and `summarize`. How does the class manage player data, track scores, and generate a leaderboard? What is the purpose of the `summarize` method, and how does it utilize the `get_leaderboard` method to provide a sorted representation of player scores? Additionally, discuss potential use cases for this class in game development and suggest any improvements or modern libraries that could enhance its functionality.
